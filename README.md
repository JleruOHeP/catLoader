# catLoader
Simple code example project

2 and a half projects here:
cat loader - main console application, that loads people data from the service and then structures it in a required manner.
cat loader tests - small xunit tests
helper service in node + express - to provide the testing service during the development, plus one of the tests is reading from this service (http://localhost:3000 by default).
